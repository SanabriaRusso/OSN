# Open Sensor Network

Files concerning the OSN pilot, which is being executed for the bottom-up broadband for Europe (BuB4EU) project.

Here you'll find the code I'm writing (written in Python and C/C++), the thesis I'm working on as well as some documentation necessary for the completion of this project, such as papers and datasheets.

Each folder has its own *README.md* file, but if you still have any doubts, feel free to contact me.
